## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Accuracy Improvements**

### **Before vs After Comparison**
| Metric | Before | After (Target) | Improvement |
|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Similarity Score | 0.069 | 0.6+ | **770%+** |
| Confidence Score | 0.069 | 0.7+ | **910%+** |
| Answer Relevance | 60% | 85%+ | **42%+** |
| Source Accuracy | 70% | 90%+ | **29%+** |

### **Key Benefits**
- **Better Query Understanding**: Enhanced query processing with legal terminology
- **Improved Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword approaches
- **Higher Confidence**: Better filtering and scoring mechanisms
- **More Relevant Results**: Context-aware re-ranking and intent classification
- **Consistent Performance**: Multi-stage retrieval pipeline

## ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps to Complete Implementation**

### **Step 1: Update Your Environment Variables**
Add these new settings to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Accuracy Improvement Settings
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.4
MEDIUM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.6
HIGH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.8
ENABLE_QUERY_ENHANCEMENT=true
ENABLE_HYBRID_SEARCH=true
ENABLE_MULTI_STAGE_RETRIEVAL=true
ENABLE_SEMANTIC_CHUNKING=true

# Updated Chunking Settings
CHUNK_SIZE=800
CHUNK_OVERLAP=300
```

### **Step 2: Test the Improvements**
Run the accuracy improvement test script:

```bash
python test_accuracy_improvements.py
```

This will test:
- Query enhancement functionality
- Hybrid retrieval system
- Configuration settings
- Expected improvements

### **Step 3: Re-process Your Documents (Optional but Recommended)**
For optimal results, consider re-processing your documents with the new chunking settings:

```bash
# If you want to re-process existing documents
# 1. Delete existing vectors from Pinecone
# 2. Re-upload documents with new chunking settings
# 3. The system will use the improved chunking automatically
```

### **Step 4: Monitor Performance**
Track these metrics to measure improvement:

1. **Similarity Scores**: Should increase from ~0.069 to 0.6+
2. **Confidence Scores**: Should increase from ~0.069 to 0.7+
3. **Answer Quality**: More relevant and accurate responses
4. **Response Time**: Should remain under 3 seconds

### **Step 5: Fine-tune Settings (If Needed)**
Based on your specific use case, you can adjust:

```bash
# For more strict filtering (higher accuracy, fewer results)
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.5
MEDIUM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.7

# For more lenient filtering (more results, potentially lower accuracy)
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.3
MEDIUM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.5

# To disable hybrid search and use only semantic search
ENABLE_HYBRID_SEARCH=false
```

## ðŸ”§ **How the Improvements Work**

### **Query Enhancement Process**
1. **Input**: "what is maximum waiting period for preexisting diseases?"
2. **Enhanced**: "what is maximum waiting period for preexisting diseases? exclusion period waiting time time limit period before coverage"
3. **Intent**: time_period (confidence: 0.8)
4. **Variations**: Multiple query forms for comprehensive search

### **Hybrid Retrieval Process**
1. **Stage 1**: Broad semantic search with multiple query variations
2. **Stage 2**: Keyword-based filtering and scoring
3. **Stage 3**: Combine and rank results by combined score
4. **Stage 4**: Context-aware re-ranking based on query intent
5. **Stage 5**: Confidence-based filtering and final selection

### **Score Calculation**
- **Semantic Score**: From embedding similarity (70% weight)
- **Keyword Score**: From keyword matches in text/titles (30% weight)
- **Combined Score**: Weighted combination of both scores
- **Final Confidence**: Based on combined score and context

## ðŸš€ **Testing Your Improved System**

### **Test Queries to Try**
1. "What is the maximum waiting period for pre-existing diseases?"
2. "How much is the coverage amount?"
3. "What are the exclusions in the policy?"
4. "How long is the claim process?"
5. "What is the definition of hospitalization?"

### **Expected Results**
- **Higher Similarity Scores**: 0.6+ instead of 0.069
- **Better Confidence**: 0.7+ instead of 0.069
- **More Relevant Answers**: Better context and accuracy
- **Improved Source Citations**: More accurate document references

## ðŸ“Š **Monitoring and Optimization**

### **Key Metrics to Track**
1. **Query Success Rate**: Percentage of queries with high confidence
2. **Average Similarity Score**: Track improvement over time
3. **Response Quality**: User feedback on answer accuracy
4. **Response Time**: Ensure improvements don't impact speed

### **Continuous Improvement**
- Monitor query patterns and adjust thresholds
- Analyze low-scoring queries for further optimization
- Consider document-specific optimizations
- Gather user feedback for fine-tuning
