and

ABC Ventures, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business at 456 Venture Boulevard, New York, NY 10001 ("Receiving Party").

1. PURPOSE

The Parties wish to explore a potential business relationship relating to potential investment and strategic partnership opportunities (the "Purpose"). In connection with the Purpose, Disclosing Party may disclose to Receiving Party certain confidential and proprietary information, and the Parties wish to protect the confidentiality of such information.

2. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

2.1 "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, that is designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation, or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to:

(a) technical information, including patent applications, inventions, discoveries, trade secrets, know-how, software, research, operations, processes, products, algorithms, formulae, data, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, and technical specifications;

(b) business information, including business plans, forecasts, strategies, operations, policies, procedures, financial information, pricing information, customer lists, supplier information, marketing plans, and personnel information; and

(c) the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

2.2 Confidential Information shall not include any information that:

(a) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by Disclosing Party;

(b) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party through no action or inaction of Receiving Party;

(c) is already in the possession of Receiving Party at the time of disclosure by Disclosing Party, as shown by Receiving Party's files and records;

(d) is obtained by Receiving Party from a third party without a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or

(e) is independently developed by Receiving Party without use of or reference to Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in Receiving Party's possession.

3. NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-USE

3.1 Receiving Party shall:

(a) hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take reasonable precautions to protect such Confidential Information (including, without limitation, all precautions Receiving Party employs with respect to its own confidential materials);

(b) not divulge any Confidential Information to any third party, except to employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, and advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who need to know such information for the Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein;

(c) not copy or reverse engineer any materials containing Confidential Information or remove any proprietary markings from any Confidential Information; and

(d) only use the Confidential Information for the Purpose and not for any other purpose.

3.2 Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives and agrees to take all reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.

4. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE

If Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose any Confidential Information, Receiving Party will promptly notify Disclosing Party in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to facilitate Disclosing Party seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. Receiving Party agrees to cooperate with Disclosing Party in seeking such order or other remedy. Receiving Party further agrees that if Disclosing Party is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

5. RETURN OF MATERIALS

Upon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the Purpose, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, or (iii) at any time upon the request of Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall promptly return to Disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic or other form or media, of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to Disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may retain copies of Confidential Information that are stored on Receiving Party's IT backup and disaster recovery systems until the ordinary course deletion thereof. Receiving Party shall continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to such retained Confidential Information.

6. NO RIGHTS OR LICENSES

Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Receiving Party under any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right of Disclosing Party, nor shall this Agreement grant Receiving Party any rights in or to the Confidential Information, except the limited right to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating the Parties to enter into any other agreement or business arrangement, or to refrain from entering into an agreement or business arrangement with any third party.

7. NO WARRANTY

ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS." DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof.

Receiving Party shall not export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export license or other governmental approval without first obtaining such license or approval.

10.11 Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges that a breach by a Party of Section 3 (Non-Disclosure and Non-Use) may cause the non-breaching Party irreparable damages, for which an award of damages would not be adequate compensation and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including a restraining order, injunctive relief, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled at law or in equity.
