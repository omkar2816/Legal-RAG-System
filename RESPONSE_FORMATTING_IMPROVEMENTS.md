# Response Formatting and Threshold Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Legal RAG System's response formatting and similarity threshold handling. These enhancements ensure consistent, well-structured responses with proper length control and intelligent threshold management.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Structured Response Formatting**

#### Response Types
The system now classifies responses into specific types for better formatting:

- **DIRECT_ANSWER**: For factual questions (e.g., waiting periods, coverage amounts)
- **PROCEDURAL**: For process-related questions (e.g., how to submit claims)
- **EXCLUSION**: For limitation and exclusion questions
- **COVERAGE**: For coverage and benefit questions
- **CLAIM**: For claim-related questions
- **GENERAL**: For other types of questions

#### Response Structure
All responses now follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "answer": "Formatted answer with proper length and structure",
  "response_type": "direct_answer",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "total_sources": 2,
  "threshold_used": 0.75,
  "query_processed": "original query",
  "sources": [
    {
      "doc_id": "doc_123",
      "doc_title": "Policy Document",
      "section_title": "Section 1.1",
      "similarity_score": 0.85,
      "threshold_used": 0.75,
      "retrieval_method": "semantic_search",
      "page_number": 5,
      "chunk_id": "section_1_chunk_3",
      "text_preview": "Truncated text preview..."
    }
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Low confidence response - consider rephrasing your question"
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Threshold Handling**

#### Adaptive Threshold Calculation
The system now uses sophisticated adaptive threshold logic:

```python
def _calculate_effective_threshold(self, score, base_threshold, adaptive, all_scores):
    # Enhanced logic based on score distribution
    if all_scores and len(all_scores) > 1:
        max_score = max(all_scores)
        min_score = min(all_scores)
        score_range = max_score - min_score
        mean_score = sum(all_scores) / len(all_scores)
        variance = sum((s - mean_score) ** 2 for s in all_scores) / len(all_scores)
        std_dev = variance ** 0.5
        
        # Adaptive adjustments based on score characteristics
        if score_range > 0.4:  # Wide range
            if max_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
                effective_threshold = max(effective_threshold, mean_score + std_dev * 0.5)
        elif score_range < 0.2:  # Narrow range
            effective_threshold = min(effective_threshold, mean_score - std_dev * 0.5)
```

#### Threshold Configuration
Configurable threshold levels in `config/settings.py`:

```python
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.2
MEDIUM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.5
HIGH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.8
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD = True
MIN_RESULTS_REQUIRED = 1
```

### 3. **Length Control and Text Processing**

#### Response Length Constraints
- **Direct Answers**: Max 250 characters
- **Procedural**: Max 300 characters
- **Exclusions**: Max 280 characters
- **Coverage**: Max 300 characters
- **Claims**: Max 350 characters
- **General**: Max 300 characters

#### Text Cleaning
- Removes common LLM artifacts
- Ensures proper capitalization
- Maintains sentence structure
- Truncates at sentence boundaries

### 4. **Enhanced Prompt Template**

The LLM prompt template has been improved:

```jinja2
You are a professional legal assistant specializing in insurance policy analysis. Your task is to provide clear, accurate, and concise answers based on the provided policy documents.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Answer ONLY based on the provided context - do not make assumptions
2. Keep responses concise (150-300 words maximum)
3. Use clear, professional language
4. If specific information is not found, state this clearly
5. For waiting periods, exclusions, or limitations, be explicit about the details
6. For procedural information, provide step-by-step guidance
7. Always cite the specific policy section when possible

Context from Policy Documents:
{{ context }}

Question: {{ question }}

Please provide a structured response that directly addresses the question using only the information available in the context above.
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Waiting Period Query
**Input Query**: "what is waiting period for this policy"

**Formatted Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "Based on the policy document, there is no specific waiting period mentioned in the provided section. The document discusses claim notification procedures and required documents for hospitalization treatment, but does not contain information about waiting periods for coverage to begin.",
  "response_type": "direct_answer",
  "confidence": 0.06,
  "total_sources": 1,
  "threshold_used": 0.06,
  "query_processed": "what is waiting period for this policy",
  "sources": [...],
  "warnings": [
    "Low confidence response - consider rephrasing your question",
    "Using low similarity threshold - results may be less relevant"
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: High Confidence Response
**Input Query**: "what documents are required for claim submission"

**Formatted Response**:
```json
{
  "answer": "According to the policy procedures: The following documents are required for claim submission: duly completed claim form, photo identity proof of the patient, medical practitioner's prescription advising admission, original bills with itemized break-up, payment receipts, discharge summary including complete medical history, investigation/diagnostic test reports, OT notes or surgeon's certificate for surgical cases, sticker/invoice of implants where applicable, MLR copy and FIR if applicable, NEFT details and cancelled cheque, KYC documents for claims above Rs. 1 Lakh, and legal heir/succession certificate where applicable.",
  "response_type": "procedural",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "total_sources": 1,
  "threshold_used": 0.75,
  "query_processed": "what documents are required for claim submission",
  "sources": [...]
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Response Formatter Class**

The `LegalResponseFormatter` class provides:

- **Response Classification**: Automatically determines response type
- **Text Processing**: Cleans and formats answers
- **Length Control**: Applies appropriate length constraints
- **Source Formatting**: Standardizes source information
- **Warning Generation**: Provides helpful warnings based on response quality

### 2. **Enhanced API Integration**

The query API (`/api/routes/query.py`) now:

- Uses the response formatter for all responses
- Handles errors gracefully with formatted error responses
- Provides consistent response structure
- Includes threshold information in all responses

### 3. **Threshold Management**

The advanced retrieval engine now:

- Calculates adaptive thresholds based on score distribution
- Provides detailed threshold information in results
- Handles edge cases (no results, low confidence)
- Logs threshold adjustments for debugging

## Configuration Options

### Response Formatter Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class ResponseConfig:
    max_length: int = 300
    min_length: int = 50
    include_sources: bool = True
    include_confidence: bool = True
    include_threshold_info: bool = True
    format_type: str = "structured"
```

### Threshold Configuration
```python
# In config/settings.py
MIN_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.2
MEDIUM_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.5
HIGH_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.8
ADAPTIVE_THRESHOLD = True
MIN_RESULTS_REQUIRED = 1
```
